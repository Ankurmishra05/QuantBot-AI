# Quant Bot AI

Quant Bot AI is a reinforcement learning-based trading system built in Python, designed to train and evaluate agents on real historical stock market data. It is modular, extensible, and ready for deployment in research and live trading scenarios.

## **Project Highlights**

- **Custom Trading Environment**
  - Gym-compatible environments (`SimpleTradingEnv`, `EnhancedTradingEnv`) for RL-based trading.
  - Uses real historical data from yfinance.

- **Data Handling**
  - Loads and processes stock data (e.g., RELIANCE.NS, 2015â€“2025).
  - Handles missing data, extracts features: price, volume, returns, moving averages.

- **Reinforcement Learning Agent**
  - Implements a custom Q-Learning agent.
  - Uses epsilon-greedy exploration, experience replay, and a simple Q-table.

- **Training & Evaluation**
  - Train agent over multiple episodes.
  - Compare results to a random strategy benchmark.
  - Performance statistics and plots: portfolio evolution, exploration decay, training rewards.

- **Deployment Ready**
  - Saves trained agent (`trained_trading_agent.pkl`) for future deployment.
  - Deployment checklist: automate real-time data, risk management, paper trading, live trading integration.

## **End-to-End Workflow**

1. **Data Acquisition**
   - Download historical price data using `yfinance`.
   - Preprocess and feature engineer for RL input.

2. **Environment Setup**
   - Define trading environments with reward structures and episode management.

3. **Agent Training**
   - Train Q-Learning agent with experience replay and exploration decay.

4. **Evaluation**
   - Plot training progress, compare to benchmark strategies, analyze portfolio statistics.

5. **Deployment**
   - Save agent state for future use in live or paper trading.

## **Visualization**

- Portfolio performance over time
- Training rewards per episode
- Exploration rate decay
- Strategy comparison charts

---

## **Modular Design**

- Environment, agent, training, and evaluation code are separated for easy extension.
- Ready for advanced RL algorithms and new features.

## **Suggestions for Improvement**

1. **Experiment with More RL Algorithms**
   - Try Deep Q-Networks (DQN), Policy Gradients, Actor-Critic methods.

2. **Risk Management**
   - Add stop-loss, position sizing, maximum drawdown limits, etc.

3. **Hyperparameter Tuning**
   - Experiment with learning rates, window sizes, reward functions.

4. **Feature Engineering**
   - Add technical indicators (RSI, MACD, Bollinger Bands), sentiment analysis, macroeconomic data.

5. **Backtesting on Different Assets**
   - Test on other stocks or assets for robustness.

6. **Live/Paper Trading Integration**
   - Connect to a broker API for real or simulated trades.

---

## **Next Steps for Deployment**

- Integrate with real-time data sources.
- Implement robust risk management checks.
- Set up logging and monitoring for live performance.
- Test with paper trading (simulated trades).
- Gradually move to live trading with small positions.

## **Getting Started**

1. Clone the repository.
2. Install requirements (`pip install -r requirements.txt`).
3. Run the main notebook or script to train and evaluate the agent.
4. Explore, modify, and extend environments, agents, and features as needed.
